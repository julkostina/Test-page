Link for deployed site: https://julkostina.github.io/Test-page/
Notes for use and about some development details:
The site is available on all devices, responsive design is made with media queries. 
For styling was used SASS for its convinient features that make development more easier(nesting, mixins, media queries, variables). 
In 2 sections was used Swiper.js for creating sliders. At the page there is a slider with pictures(pictures were taken from API, because of lack of availble pictures) and a box with theme changing button(it controls ProvidedServiceSection and a slider-container-caption class in SliderSection component).
Then there is a sticky navigation bar with links to corresponding sections. Below there is a slider that can be filtered by type, occupation and search by name is available. After user can see some informations and a form for a user responce is there. At the end of the page a footer with active links.
